# Deploying a React/Javascript app
* SSH into your VPS and update:  
$ `sudo apt update`

* Install Node.js & npm:  
In production, it is generally recommended to use the [Long Term Support versions](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).  
These are the even-numbered versions at which node.js is considered production-ready.  
The odd number versions are not LTS and you should generally stay away from them.  
The current LTS release is 10 (check in above link). If you want to install a different version
you can change the 10 to whatever version youâ€™d like. Since we need Node.js only for deploying,
and not for development purposes, we will be using apt and the NodeSource repository
(instead of the Default Ubuntu repository).  
NodeSource is a company focused on providing enterprise-grade Node support and they maintain
a repository containing the latest versions of Node.js.
(The Default Ubuntu repository only contains a single Node.js version, and very likely not a LTS release.)   

  > **Note:**  
  > For development purposes it is recommended to install Node.js using the NVM script.
  > NVM, or Node Version Manager, is a bash script used to
  > [manage multiple active Node.js versions](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/#install-node-js-and-npm-using-nvm).
  

  NodeSource allows us to install a specific Node.js version on our VPS:  
  - Enable the NodeSource repository with the following curl command:   
  $ `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`  
  - Once the NodeSource repository is enabled, install Node.js and npm by typing:  
  $ `sudo apt install nodejs`  
  The nodejs package contains both the node and npm binaries.
  - Verify that Node.js and npm were installed successfully by printing their versions:  
  $ `node --version`  
  $ `npm --version`  

* Create the directory the web app will reside in:   
$ `sudo mkdir /www`  
$ `cd /www`  

* Constantly using sudo increases the chances of accidentally trashing the system,
so let's give our user ownership to this directory:   
$ `sudo chown -R david:www-data /www`   
This changes the user from 'root' to 'david'. We also change the group from 'root' to 'www-data';
this is the group under which common web servers like Apache and Nginx run.
This is necessary because Nginx also needs access to the files.
(Note that using the '-R' flag is pointless if the directory is still empty.)

* Since we also want newly created files/directories to inherit the group of its parent directory (www-data)
instead of its creator (e.g. 'david'), we set the setgid bit on the /www directory:   
$ `sudo chmod g+s /www`   
The setgid bit will be inherited on subdirectories when they are created.
This is exactly what we need: effectively all files/directories/subdirectories inside '/www' will inherit
the group from '/www' ('www-data').   
(Note that if you forget sudo, it will NOT set the setgid bit, and return no error of failure (Ubuntu bug).
Make sure it's effectively set with `ls -l`; there should be an 's' instead of an 'x' in the group execute permissions.)  
See [chmod.md](../chmod.md) for more details on its functioning.

* Create a directory for our website/domain, and cd into it:   
$ `mkdir [domain]`   
$ `cd [domain]`   

* $ `git clone [Repository-URL]`   
Use https to `git clone`, since we haven't set up a deploy key for SSH yet, then cd into it and install:   
(you should never need to use sudo with npm)   
$ `cd [React-App-Repo]`   
$ `npm install`   
$ `npm run build`   
This will create an optimized production build.

* Optionally, to increase security, we can also restrict access permissions for 'other' by combining
the 'find' command with the 'chmod' command:   
$ `find /www -type f -exec chmod 0640 {} \;`   
$ `sudo find /www -type d -exec chmod 2750 {} \;`   
Be sure to not forget sudo and the leading '2' in the permissions in the last command,
otherwise you will unset the setgid bit.
(Buggy Ubuntu behaviour: if we are not a member of the group a file belongs to,
any use of chmod that does not actively set setgid will actually unset it.
Alternatively, we could add ourself to the www-data group with `sudo adduser david www-data`.)
See [this](../bash.md#-find) for an explanation of the `find` command.  
Note that the only case where www-data needs write permissions is for directories storing uploads
and other locations which needs to be written, so we do not assign any group write permissions.

* Optionally, we can change the umask so all files created in the future will restrict access for 'other',
by putting `umask 027` in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Note that this is a global setting for the server.

* Install Nginx to serve our application:   
$ `sudo apt install nginx`   

* Configuring Nginx:   
$ `sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.bak`   
$ `sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`   
Inside vi in the 'default' file, you have to set the website root and your domain name:   
  ```
  server {
      listen 80 default_server;
      listen [::]:80 default_server;

      root /www/[domain]/[React-App-Repo]/build;

      # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
      index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

      server_name [mydomain.com];

      location / {
              # First attempt to serve request as file, then
              # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
              try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
      }
  }
  ```

* Save and exit, and run `sudo nginx -t` to check if the configuration is ok.
If it's not, knowing there is an error in the config file is already a great step towards solving the problem.
Make sure spelling and syntax is ok. Pay attention to what the error tells you and troubleshoot.

* When everything is ok, start up Nginx!   
$ `sudo service nginx start`

* If you changed the repository or made changes to the configuration, you can restart Nginx with:   
$ `sudo service nginx restart`
