# Domain name registrar setup
We have chosen [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) as our domain name registrar.
Porkbun is not a well-known registrar, but it is synonymous with quality at a good price, unlike most big registrars
with lots of name recognition. It also provides free wildcard SSL certificates, so you can set up encryption
to enable `https` on your entire domain (and all its subdomains!).

## Porkbun domain registration
* Log in, register a credit card, verify your email address and set up two-factor authentication for security.
* When the administration is done, use the Porkbun search bar to find the domain you want to buy, and click the `+` button.
* Click `Checkout`, and choose for how many years you want to buy the domain.
Remember you can always renew when it expires, so you don't need to go crazy; 1 or 2 years is fine.
* Make the payment and the domain is yours. It's that simple.
* Now that we have a domain, we still need an actual server on which our website will run.
There are countless 'hosting companies' which provide this service. For developers, VPS (= Virtual Private Server)
or cloud hosting is generally preferable. Continue with [VPS setup](./2--vps-setup.md).
